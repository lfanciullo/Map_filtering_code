# Map_filtering_code
Code to filter the large scales from SOFIA maps and compare them to POL-2.

## Available folders
### Map_files
Contains the FITS files of maps (real or simulated). 

Current content:
* I, Q, U for "toy" synthetic observations
    * Three structure types: filament, radially symmetric core, elongated cores + filament
    * Noiseless and noisy versions of each
    * Units of Jy/arcsec^2, realistic fluxes for HAWC+ band D (154 um)

### Figures
Plots of maps or any form of data visualization.

Current content:
* Quiver plots for the three synthetic structures (filament, radially symmetric core, elongated cores + filament), noiseless
